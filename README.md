# The Tech Town
"The Tech Town" is going to be a community made by students for the students. The main aim of this community is to provide a well-maintained platform where students can easily interact with each other and find new opportunities. 

All types of students are welcome to join the community but initially, we only are focusing on tech and science-related students. As our community grows we take more and more members from different fields.

It is going to be 100% free and all the team members here will be volunteers. Different roles will be given to different team members based on their skills. Only active and suitable members will be accepted as a volunteer.

In this way "everyone is serving while they are getting served".

Members will learn a skill in this community and we will allow them to work in the group itself so that they can implement and improve what they have learned because it's always better to learn a skill with practice and get volunteer experience along with the certificate.

Major Team Roles Required :
1) Content Creator - To create content on single or multiple topics to help students online and eventually help in organic marketing.
2) Graphic Designer - To add thumbnails to posts or present content in a more visual manner. 
3) Promoters - They will majorly be helping in promoting the community and gathering students through multiple platforms. 
4) Telegram Bot Developer: This is the dev who will build specialized bots for the community based on requirements.
5) Admins - To help the community, set up bots, and remove scammers.
6) Helpers - They will be actively looking into each work to make sure everything goes accordingly and if urgent they need to work themselves to get the job done.

Inside the community, everyone will be called and treated like we are in a real town. Cowboy, Handyman, Photographer, Graphic designer, Journalist, Lawyer, etc. these names will be given to members with a similar talent to what the name suggests.
